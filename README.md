# Blog Generator with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This repository contains a blog generator that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create high-quality blog posts. The generator works by taking a set of input keywords, searching for relevant URLs, parsing HTML content from the search results, storing the content in a vector database, and generating a blog post based on the retrieved context.

Features
Keyword-based Search: Provide a set of keywords, and the generator will automatically search for relevant URLs.
HTML Parsing and Extraction: The HTML content of each relevant URL is parsed to extract meaningful information.
Vector Database Storage: Extracted content is stored in a vector database, enabling efficient similarity search.
Blog Post Generation: Using the stored data, a blog post is generated based on context retrieved from the vector database, ensuring relevant and accurate content.
How It Works
Input Keywords:

The user provides a set of keywords that define the topic or theme for the blog post.
Search for Relevant URLs:

The system searches for relevant URLs based on the provided keywords using a search engine API (e.g., Google, Bing).
Parse HTML from URLs:

HTML content from the URLs is parsed to extract the text and relevant information. This data will serve as the foundation for blog post generation.
Create and Store Vector Database:

The extracted data is stored in a vector database. Each document is converted into embeddings using a pre-trained model, allowing for efficient semantic search.
Blog Post Generation:

Using RAG, the model retrieves relevant information from the vector database and generates a blog post based on the context it retrieves. The generated post will be highly relevant to the input keywords, while leveraging content from various online sources.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-generator-rag.git
cd blog-generator-rag
Install Dependencies:

Use pip or pdm to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
or

bash
Copy code
pdm install
Set Up Vector Database:

The vector database can be implemented using FAISS or Chroma. Follow the installation instructions of your preferred vector database library and ensure it is running before proceeding.

API Key Configuration:

The blog generator relies on search engine APIs to retrieve relevant URLs. Set up your API keys in an environment file or directly within the config file:

Google Search API or Bing Search API.

Update the .env file with your API key:

makefile
Copy code
SEARCH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Usage
1. Input Keywords
Provide the input keywords to the generator to define the theme of the blog post. This can be done via a simple command line interface (CLI) or integrated into a web app.

bash
Copy code
python generate_blog.py --keywords "AI in healthcare, machine learning"
2. Generate Blog Post
Once the keywords are processed and relevant content is retrieved, the blog post will be generated:

bash
Copy code
python generate_blog.py --keywords "AI in healthcare, machine learning"
The script will:

Search for relevant URLs.
Parse the HTML content from those URLs.
Create a vector database with the parsed content.
Generate a blog post using RAG.
3. Output
The final blog post will be saved in a file (output/blog_post.txt) or printed directly to the console.

Configuration
Vector Database: You can choose the vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma). Make sure to configure this in the settings file (config.py).
Search Engine API: The search engine (e.g., Google, Bing) and API key should be set in the .env file.
Pre-trained Models: The system uses a pre-trained model (such as BERT, GPT, or OpenAI's models) for embedding generation and RAG.
Example
bash
Copy code
python generate_blog.py --keywords "machine learning in healthcare"
Output Blog Post:

Future Work
Improve HTML parsing: Improve the parsing process to focus on the main content and filter out irrelevant data such as ads or menus.
UI for Keyword Input: Develop a user-friendly interface for entering keywords and viewing the generated blog posts.
More advanced RAG model: Experiment with various retrieval and generation techniques to improve the quality of blog posts.
